# Scraper's Preservation Project

Scraper's Preservation Project (SPP in short) is a collaborative work with the objective 
of preserving books, academic texts and other files in various languages.

The final objective is to upload these files to an open, easily replicable and centralized source.

This is done through web's most loved and hated tool: scraping.
